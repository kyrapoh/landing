		<h2>What is Indoor Skydiving?</h2>
		<p> 
			Ever dreamed of flying? Be a part of our indoor skydiving community TODAY! Indoor skydiving, also known as vertical wind tunnel skydiving or FLYING is an extreme sport in which participants simulate the freefall portion of a skydive without actually jumping out of an airplane. This allows them to float and maneuver in the air, performing various tricks and acrobatics. There are World Championships where over 250 of the TOP flyers from each country come together and compete!
